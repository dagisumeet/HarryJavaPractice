        // it goes left to right. it is evaluated on the basis of precedence value.
//        Operator precedance work as
//        PEMDAS
//        P - Parenthesis,
//        E - Exponential
//        M - Multiplication
//        D - Division
//        A - Addition
//        S - Subtraction
//        When two operator of same precedance are encountered(like [* /], [+ -]) it evaluates from left to right.
